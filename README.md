# GroupMeet

## Description:

GroupMeet is a tool to make organizing group school work simple. The web app will have a calendar to easily find times when group members’ schedules overlap in order to plan group meetings. Groups will also be able to add project tasks and manage them to clearly visualize project progress to completion. The app will need to store group members, tasks, and scheduling data. The schedule will will be stored as an array of one hour chunks with each members’ availability. Additional functionality that could be added if time allows would be Google Calendar integration and emailing.
